# Golden Sentence Standards (金句标准)

⚠️ **Short insights are the easiest to get wrong. Apply strict filtering.**

## The 4 Iron Rules

Every short insight must pass all 4 tests:

1. ✅ **Independence** - Stranger scrolling by can understand, max 1-2 sentences of context (total ≤100 characters)
2. ✅ **Completeness** - Has complete meaning, not half a sentence
3. ✅ **Impact** - Has data/contrast/counter-intuitive/emotional resonance
4. ✅ **Non-duplication** - Not already expanded in a long post

### Test Method

For each potential insight, ask:
- Can a stranger understand it? (without much context)
- Is it interesting? (has impact)
- Will they pause to think or like? (has value)

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Needs Too Much Context

**Bad Example:**
> "激励Gemini多好，我激励人干嘛？"

**Problem:** What are we talking about? Why incentivize Gemini?

**Why it fails:** Needs the full conversation context to understand.

---

### ❌ Mistake 2: Just Numbers, No Meaning

**Bad Example:**
> "Plaud 3亿美金 vs 影石10亿人民币"

**Problem:** Two numbers being compared - so what?

**Why it fails:** No interpretation, no insight, just data.

---

### ❌ Mistake 3: Requires Industry Background

**Bad Example:**
> "剪映还在纠结做工具还是社区"

**Problem:** Why is this a dilemma? What's the impact?

**Why it fails:** Need to know the product and industry context.

## Correct Examples

### ✅ Example 1: Add Simple Background (80 characters)

```
朋友吐槽，在大厂做AI的感受是：

很多人没那么拥抱AI，但又要做，然后又不理解，还要逼逼。
```

**Why it works:**
- Has emotion
- Has resonance (many people feel this way)
- Doesn't need much background

---

### ✅ Example 2: Has Shocking Contrast (120 characters)

```
Plaud，一个做AI录音笔的公司，今年预计营收3亿美金。

什么概念？做了很多年、技术硬核的影石，一年营收也就10亿人民币。

这就是AI硬件的红利期。
```

**Why it works:**
- Data has shock value
- Clear contrast (new simple product vs old complex product)
- Has interpretation ("AI硬件的红利期")

---

### ✅ Example 3: Add 1-2 Sentences Background (80 characters)

```
面试一个00后，问他"你怎么理解AI native？"

他回答："什么是AI native？"

这是我听过最正确的答案。怎么可能问一个鱼什么是水？
```

**Why it works:**
- Has a story
- Has the golden sentence ("怎么可能问一个鱼什么是水？")
- Complete meaning

## Filtering Philosophy

**宁缺毋滥 - Quality Over Quantity:**

Quality standard is FIXED. Quantity is the NATURAL RESULT of strict filtering.

- **If 0 insights pass** → Output 0 (most common, this is OK!)
- **If 1 insight passes** → Output 1
- **If 5 insights pass** → Output 5
- **If 10 insights pass** → Output 10

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ Force output when nothing passes ("需要3条" mentality)
- ❌ Artificially limit quantity when many pass ("最多2条" mentality)
- ❌ Lower standards to meet quota
- ❌ Skip good insights because "already have enough"

**When to output ZERO insights:**
- All candidates need too much context (>100 chars total)
- All candidates are already expanded in long posts
- All candidates lack sufficient impact
- No clear "aha moment" or shock value

**The goal:** Every insight you output should make you think "这条真的可以单独发即刻". If you hesitate, don't output it.

## Additional Guidelines

1. **Keep it concise** - Insight + background should not exceed 150 characters total
2. **Don't repeat materials** - If used in a long post, don't use again as standalone insight
3. **Quality over quantity** - 1 good insight > 3 mediocre ones
4. **Test on strangers** - If you wouldn't send it to someone without context, it needs work
