# Writing Standards & Checklist

## Quality Checklist

Before outputting any piece, verify:

### Structure & Logic
✅ Does the opening directly present the core viewpoint?
✅ If you delete any sentence, does the logic break? (If not broken, delete it)
✅ Do cases serve the theme? (If not, delete them)
✅ Are there specific data and cases? (If too abstract, add details)
✅ **Is structure invisible?** (Critical for Jike)
   - Logic flows naturally without forced sections?
   - No excessive bold subheadings (**小标题**)?
   - No numbered lists (1. 2. 3.) unless user's style uses them?
   - Reads like feed content, not like article?

### Accuracy
✅ **Fact check completed?** (CRITICAL)
   - All proper nouns verified (names, companies, products)?
   - All data points confirmed (revenue, valuations, dates)?
   - Transcripts contain errors - always search to verify

### Tone & Style
✅ Does it have a clear attitude? (Don't be too hedged)
✅ Is it preachy? (Delete "建议/应该/recommend/should")
✅ Does the tone match user's style?
✅ Is the length appropriate? (Deleted everything possible)

## Content Quality Principles

### 1. Don't Farm Anxiety
- Provide insights, don't manufacture panic
- Explain phenomena, don't amplify fears
- Offer frameworks, don't make people feel inadequate

### 2. Don't Preach Excessively
- Provide frameworks, don't "teach people how to live"
- Share observations, don't prescribe solutions
- Avoid: "你应该...", "建议...", "最好..."
- Prefer: Direct observations and logical reasoning

### 3. Don't Pile Up Cases
- Cases serve logic, not padding for word count
- One powerful case > three mediocre ones
- Case should illustrate the point, not dominate the piece

### 4. Don't Deviate from Theme
- One piece = one insight
- Resist urge to cover everything
- If a point doesn't serve the main theme, save it for another piece

### 5. Don't Ignore Data
- Specific numbers > abstract descriptions
- "3亿美金 vs 10亿人民币" > "增长很快"
- "工作两年以上不看" > "偏好年轻人"
- Data creates credibility and impact

### 6. Don't Be Too Formal
- Have attitude, don't hedge
- Make clear judgments
- "我操" is fine if it matches user's style
- Avoid corporate-speak and platitudes

## Style Matching

### When User Provides Reference Style

**First piece**: Closely match tone, structure, vocabulary
**Second piece**: Keep core style, but don't force it
**Third piece**: More natural, less imitation

Pay attention to:
- Information density (data-heavy / case-heavy / opinion-heavy)
- Emotional words (克制 / 直接 / 幽默)
- Paragraph length (short punchy sentences vs longer explanations)
- Opening style (direct statement / question / story / data)

### When User Doesn't Provide Reference

Base on the raw content's language characteristics:
- **If raw content is casual, emotional** → Keep it casual, preserve "我操/卧槽"
- **If raw content is professional, rational** → Stay measured, use data and cases
- **If raw content is conversational** → Can keep dialogue format, more authentic
- **If raw content is structured notes** → Extract into structured viewpoints

## Platform Constraints

- **Maximum length**: 1000 characters (Jike platform limit)
- **Optimal lengths**:
  - Short insights: 20-150 characters
  - Phenomenon posts: 150-300 characters
  - Medium posts: 300-600 characters
  - Deep analysis: 600-1000 characters

## Success Criteria

A good Jike post should:

✅ Can be summarized in one sentence after reading
✅ Provides new insights or perspectives
✅ Has specific data or case support
✅ No fluff - every word earns its place
✅ Natural tone, not affected
✅ Sparks thought or discussion

## Common Weaknesses to Avoid

1. **Meandering opening** - Get to the point immediately
2. **Circular logic** - Make sure each point advances the argument
3. **Empty superlatives** - "非常好/特别棒" without specifics
4. **Hedging too much** - "可能/也许/似乎" weakens impact
5. **Obvious statements** - Don't state what everyone already knows
6. **Missing the 'so what'** - Always connect observation to insight
7. **Over-structuring (CRITICAL for Jike)** - Excessive bold subheadings, numbered lists, transition phrases make it read like PPT/公众号 instead of feed content
